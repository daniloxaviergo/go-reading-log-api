## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create performance benchmarks to measure the impact of the parallel test database uniqueness changes. The benchmarks should compare test execution times before and after the changes, ensuring that the overhead added by unique database naming doesn't significantly impact test speed. Specifically verify that test startup time increases by less than 200ms and overall test execution time doesn't regress by more than 10%.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Measure test execution time before/after changes
- [ ] #2 Ensure < 10% performance regression
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All unit tests pass use testing-expert subagent for test execution and verification
- [ ] #2 All integration tests pass use testing-expert subagent for test execution and verification
- [ ] #3 go fmt and go vet pass with no errors
- [ ] #4 Clean Architecture layers properly followed
- [ ] #5 Error responses consistent with existing patterns
- [ ] #6 HTTP status codes correct for response type
- [ ] #7 Database queries optimized with proper indexes
- [ ] #8 Documentation updated in QWEN.md
- [ ] #9 New code paths include error path tests
- [ ] #10 HTTP handlers test both success and error responses
- [ ] #11 Integration tests verify actual database interactions
- [ ] #12 Tests use testing-expert subagent for test execution and verification
